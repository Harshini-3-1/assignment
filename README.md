User Management:
View a list of all registered users.
Update user details like name and phone number.
Delete users from the list.

Technologies Used
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery
Security: bcryptjs for password hashing
Security Considerations
Passwords are stored in the database using bcryptjs to ensure they are securely hashed.
Use environment variables to store sensitive information such as the MongoDB connection string.
Future Improvements
Add user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Implement role-based access control.
Add unit and integration tests.
Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku or Vercel.
